            <h3>Fact #1</h3>
            <p> He will be buried in a pyramid that he purchased himself
            </p>
            <p>"As a celebrity, you need to think about what’s going to happen after you die. You need to keep your corpse secure from grave-robbers and crazed fans, and Nicolas Cage is set in that department. He’s got a nine foot tall stone pyramid in one of New Orleans’ most famous cemeteries that his body will be interred within."</p>

            <section class="fact">
            <h3>Fact #2</h3>
            <p> He sued Kathleen Turner because she claimed that he stole a chihuahua.
            </p>
            <p>"Hollywood is a notoriously lawsuit-happy place, but this one is bizarre by any standards. In 2008, Kathleen Turner published her memoir, Send Yourself Roses, and a chunk of it dealt with her experience working with Cage on Peggy Sue Got Married. Turner claimed that her co-star was once busted by the cops for swiping a Chihuahua. Cage protested, sued, and eventually won a public apology."</p>

            <h3>Fact #3</h3>
            <p>He once owned a pet octopus
            </p>
            <p>
            "Nicolas Cage is notorious for his profligate spending, blowing huge sums on castles, yachts, a jet and a T-rex skull. So when it came time for him to get a pet for his house, no dog or cat would do. Instead, the actor dropped a bundle on an octopus, telling the press that he needed it to 'help him with his acting.” Your guess is as good as ours on how exactly that works.'"'
